      "content": "\n<p><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/child-safety/\">Apple yesterday announced three new “Child Safety” initiatives</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>First, new communication tools will enable parents to play a more\ninformed role in helping their children navigate communication\nonline. The Messages app will use on-device machine learning to\nwarn about sensitive content, while keeping private communications\nunreadable by Apple.</p>\n\n<p>Next, iOS and iPadOS will use new applications of cryptography\nto help limit the spread of CSAM online, while designing for\nuser privacy. CSAM detection will help Apple provide valuable\ninformation to law enforcement on collections of CSAM in\niCloud Photos.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, updates to Siri and Search provide parents and children\nexpanded information and help if they encounter unsafe situations.\nSiri and Search will also intervene when users try to search for\nCSAM-related topics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(CSAM stands for <a href=\"https://www.inhope.org/EN/articles/child-sexual-abuse-material\">Child Sexual Abuse Material</a> — a.k.a. child pornography. People familiar with the lingo seem to pronounce it <em>see-sam</em>. Another acronym to know: NCMEC — <em>nick-meck</em> — the <a href=\"https://www.missingkids.org/\">National Center for Missing and Exploited Children</a>. That’s the nonprofit organization, founded and funded by the U.S. government, that maintains the database of known CSAM.)</p>\n\n<p>The third initiative — updates to Siri and Search — is the easiest to understand and, I think, uncontroversial. The first two, however, seem not well-understood, and are, justifiably, receiving intense scrutiny from privacy advocates.</p>\n\n<p>My first advice is to read <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/child-safety/\">Apple’s own high-level description of the features</a>, which ends with links to detailed technical documentation regarding the encryption and techniques Apple is employing in the implementations, and “technical assessments” from three leading researchers in cryptography and computer vision.</p>\n\n<p>The Messages feature is specifically only for children in a shared iCloud family account. If you’re an adult, nothing is changing with regard to any photos you send or receive through Messages. And if you’re a parent with children whom the feature <em>could</em> apply to, you’ll need to explicitly opt in to enable the feature. It will not turn on automatically when your devices are updated to iOS 15. If a child sends or receives (and chooses to view) an image that triggers a warning, the notification is sent from the child’s device to the parents’ devices — Apple itself is not notified, nor is law enforcement. These parental notifications are only for children 12 or younger in a family iCloud account; parents do not have the option of receiving notifications for teenagers, although teenagers can receive the content warnings on their devices.</p>\n\n<p>It’s also worth pointing out that it’s a feature of the Messages <em>app</em>, not the iMessage <em>service</em>. For one thing, this means it applies to images sent or received via SMS, not just iMessage. But more importantly, it changes nothing about the end-to-end encryption inherent to the iMessage protocol. The image processing to detect sexually explicit images happens before (for sending) or after (for receiving) the endpoints. It seems like a good feature with few downsides. (<a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life\">The EFF disagrees</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>The CSAM detection for iCloud Photo Library is more complicated, delicate, and controversial. But it only applies to images being sent to iCloud Photo Library. If you don’t use iCloud Photo Library, no images on your devices are fingerprinted. But, of course, most of us <em>do</em> use iCloud Photo Library.</p>\n\n<p>I mentioned above that Apple’s “Child Safety” page for these new features has links to technical assessments from outside experts. In particular, I thought <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Technical_Assessment_of_CSAM_Detection_Benny_Pinkas.pdf\">the description of Apple’s CSAM detection from Benny Pinkas</a> — a cryptography researcher at Bar-Ilan University in Israel — was instructive:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My research in cryptography has spanned more than 25 years. I\ninitiated the applied research on privacy preserving computation,\nan area of cryptography that makes it possible for multiple\nparticipants to run computations while concealing their private\ninputs. In particular, I pioneered research on private set\nintersection (PSI).</p>\n\n<p>The Apple PSI system solves a very challenging problem of\ndetecting photos with CSAM content while keeping the contents of\nall non-CSAM photos encrypted and private. Photos are only\nanalyzed on users’ devices. Each photo is accompanied by a safety\nvoucher that includes information about the photo, protected by\ntwo layers of encryption. This information includes a NeuralHash\nand a visual derivative of the photo. Only if the Apple cloud\nidentifies that a user is trying to upload a significant number of\nphotos with CSAM content, the information associated with these\nspecific photos can be opened by the cloud. If a user uploads less\nthan a predefined threshold number of photos containing CSAM\ncontent then the information associated with all of photos of this\nuser is kept encrypted, even if some of these photos contain CSAM\ncontent. It is important to note that no information about non-CSAM\ncontent can be revealed by the Apple PSI system. […]</p>\n\n<p>The design is accompanied by security proofs that I have evaluated\nand confirmed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For obvious reasons, this feature is <em>not</em> optional. If you use iCloud Photo Library, the images in your library will go through this fingerprinting. (This includes the images already in your iCloud Photo Library, not just newly-uploaded images after the feature ships later this year.) To opt out of this fingerprint matching, you’ll need to disable iCloud Photo Library.</p>\n\n<p>A big source of confusion seems to be what <em>fingerprinting</em> entails. Fingerprinting is not content analysis. It’s not determining <em>what</em> is in a photo. It’s just a way of assigning unique identifiers — essentially long numbers — to photos, in a way that will generate the same fingerprint identifier if the same image is cropped, resized, or even changed from color to grayscale. It’s not a way of determining whether two photos (the user’s local photo, and an image in the CSAM database from NCMEC) are of the same subject — it’s a way of determining whether they are two versions of the <em>same image</em>. If I take a photo of, say, my car, and you take a photo of my car, the images should not produce the same fingerprint even though they’re photos of the same car in the same location. And, in the same way that real-world fingerprints can’t be backwards engineered to determine what the person they belong to looks like, these fingerprints cannot be backwards engineered to determine anything at all about the subject matter of the photographs.</p>\n\n<p>The Messages features for children in iCloud family accounts <em>is</em> doing content analysis to try to identify sexually explicit photos, but is <em>not</em> checking image fingerprint hashes against the database of CSAM fingerprints.</p>\n\n<p>The CSAM detection for images uploaded to iCloud Photo Library is <em>not</em> doing content analysis, and is only checking fingerprint hashes against the database of known CSAM fingerprints. So, to name one common innocent example, if you have photos of your kids in the bathtub, or otherwise frolicking in a state of undress, no content analysis is performed that tries to detect that, hey, this is a picture of an undressed child. Fingerprints from images of similar content are not themselves similar. Two photographs of the same subject should produce entirely dissimilar fingerprints. The fingerprints of your own photos of your kids are no more likely to match the fingerprint of an image in NCMEC’s CSAM database than is a photo of a sunset or a fish.</p>\n\n<p>The database will be part of iOS 15, and is a database of fingerprints, <em>not</em> images. Apple does not have the images in NCMEC’s library of known CSAM, and in fact <em>cannot</em> — NCMEC is the only organization in the U.S. that is legally permitted to possess these photos.</p>\n\n<p>If you don’t use iCloud Photo Library, none of this applies to you. If you do use iCloud Photo Library, this detection is only applied to the images in your photo library that are synced to iCloud.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, one match isn’t enough to trigger any action. There’s a “threshold” — some number of matches against the CSAM database — that must be met. Apple isn’t saying what this threshold number is, but, for the sake of argument, let’s say that threshold is 10. With 10 or fewer matches, nothing happens, and nothing <em>can</em> happen on Apple’s end. Only after 11 matches (threshold + 1) will Apple be alerted. Even then, someone at Apple will investigate, by examining the contents of the <em>safety vouchers</em> that will accompany each photo in iCloud Photo Library. These vouchers are encrypted such that they can only be decrypted on the server side if threshold + 1 matches have been identified. From <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/child-safety/\">Apple’s own description</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Using another technology called threshold secret sharing, the\nsystem ensures the contents of the safety vouchers cannot be\ninterpreted by Apple unless the iCloud Photos account crosses a\nthreshold of known CSAM content. The threshold is set to provide\nan extremely high level of accuracy and ensures less than a one in\none trillion chance per year of incorrectly flagging a given\naccount.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even if your account is — against those one in a trillion odds, if Apple’s math is correct — <em>incorrectly</em> flagged for exceeding the threshold, someone at Apple will examine the contents of the safety vouchers for those flagged images before reporting the incident to law enforcement. Apple is cryptographically only able to examine the safety vouchers for those images whose fingerprints matched items in the CSAM database. The vouchers include a “visual derivative” of the image — basically a low-res version of the image. If innocent photos are somehow wrongly flagged, Apple’s reviewers should notice.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>All of these features are fairly grouped together under a “child safety” umbrella, but I can’t help but wonder if it was a mistake to announce them together. Many people are clearly conflating them, including those reporting on the initiative for the news media. E.g. The Washington Post’s “<em>never met an Apple story that couldn’t be painted in the worst possible light</em>” <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/05/apple-child-pornography-iphone/\">Reed Albergotti’s report</a>, the first three paragraphs of which are simply wrong<sup id=\"fnr1-2021-08-06\"><a href=\"#fn1-2021-08-06\">1</a></sup> and the headline for which is grossly misleading (“Apple Is Prying Into iPhones to Find Sexual Predators, but Privacy Activists Worry Governments Could Weaponize the Feature”).</p>\n\n<p>It’s also worth noting that fingerprint hash matching against NCMEC’s database is already happening on other major cloud hosting services and social networks. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/05/technology/apple-iphones-privacy.html\">From The New York Times’s report on Apple’s initiative</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>U.S. law requires tech companies to flag cases of child sexual\nabuse to the authorities. Apple has historically flagged fewer\ncases than other companies. Last year, for instance, Apple\nreported 265 cases to the National Center for Missing &amp;\nExploited Children, while Facebook reported 20.3 million,\naccording to the center’s statistics. That enormous gap is due\nin part to Apple’s decision not to scan for such material,\nciting the privacy of its users.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The difference going forward is that Apple will be matching fingerprints against NCMEC’s database client-side, not server-side. But I suspect others will follow suit, including Facebook and Google, with client-side fingerprint matching for end-to-end encrypted services. There is no way to perform this matching server-side with any E2EE service — between the sender and receiver endpoints, the server has no way to decrypt the images with end-to-end encryption.</p>\n\n<p>Which in turn makes me wonder if Apple sees this initiative as a necessary first step toward providing end-to-end encryption for iCloud Photo Library and iCloud device backups. <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303\">Apple has long encrypted all iCloud data that can be encrypted</a>,<sup id=\"fnr2-2021-08-06\"><a href=\"#fn2-2021-08-06\">2</a></sup> both in transit and on server, but device backups, photos, and iCloud Drive are among the things that are not <em>end-to-end</em> encrypted. Apple has the keys to decrypt them, and can be compelled to do so by law enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>In January 2020, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive-idUSKBN1ZK1CT\">Reuters reported that Apple in 2018 dropped plans to use end-to-end encryption for iCloud backups at the behest of the FBI</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple Inc. dropped plans to let iPhone users fully encrypt\nbackups of their devices in the company’s iCloud service after the\nFBI complained that the move would harm investigations, six\nsources familiar with the matter told Reuters.</p>\n\n<p>The tech giant’s reversal, about two years ago, has not previously\nbeen reported. It shows how much Apple has been willing to help\nU.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies, despite taking a\nharder line in high-profile legal disputes with the government and\ncasting itself as a defender of its customers’ information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Whether Reuters’s report that Apple caved to FBI pressure on E2EE iCloud backups is accurate or not, I don’t know, but I do know that privacy advocates (including myself) would love to see Apple enable E2EE for <em>everything</em> in iCloud, and that law enforcement agencies around the world would not. This fingerprint matching for CSAM could pave the way for a middle ground, if Apple unveils end-to-end encryption for iCloud photos and backups in the future. In such a scenario, Apple would have no cryptographic ability to turn your backups or entire photo library over to anyone, but they would be able to flag and report iCloud accounts whose photo libraries exceed the threshold for CSAM database fingerprint matches, including the “visual derivatives” of the matching photos — all without Apple ever seeing or being able to see your original photos on iCloud.</p>\n\n<p>It’s also possible Apple has simply permanently shelved plans to use end-to-end encryption for all iCloud data. No surprise: they’re not saying. But it feels very plausible to me that Apple views this privacy-protecting CSAM detection as a necessary first step to broadening the use of end-to-end encryption.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>In short, if these features work as described and <em>only</em> as described, there’s almost no cause for concern. In an interview with The New York Times for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/05/technology/apple-iphones-privacy.html\">its aforelinked report on this initiative</a>, Erik Neuenschwander, Apple’s chief privacy engineer, said, “If you’re storing a collection of CSAM material, yes, this is bad for you. But for the rest of you, this is no different.” By all accounts, that is fair and true.</p>\n\n<p>But the “if” in “if these features work as described and <em>only</em> as described” is the rub. That “if” is the whole ballgame. If you discard alarmism from critics of this initiative who clearly do not understand how the features work, you’re still left with completely legitimate concerns from trustworthy experts about how the features could be abused or misused in the future.</p>\n\n<p>What happens, for example, if China demands that it provide its own database of image fingerprints for use with this system — a database that would likely include images related to political dissent. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-48476879\">Tank man</a>, say, or any of the remarkable litany of comparisons <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=xi+jinping+looks+like+winnie+the+pooh\">showing the striking resemblance of Xi Jinping to Winnie the Pooh</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This slippery-slope argument is a legitimate concern. Apple’s response is simply that they’ll refuse. Again, from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/05/technology/apple-iphones-privacy.html\">Jack Nicas’s report for The Times</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Mr. Green said he worried that such a system could be abused\nbecause it showed law enforcement and governments that Apple now\nhad a way to flag certain content on a phone while maintaining its\nencryption. Apple has previously argued to the authorities that\nencryption prevents it from retrieving certain data.</p>\n\n<p>“What happens when other governments ask Apple to use this for\nother purposes?” Mr. Green asked. “What’s Apple going to say?”</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Neuenschwander dismissed those concerns, saying that\nsafeguards are in place to prevent abuse of the system and that\nApple would reject any such demands from a government.</p>\n\n<p>“We will inform them that we did not build the thing they’re\nthinking of,” he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Will Apple actually flatly refuse any and all such demands? If they do, it’s all good. If they don’t, and these features creep into surveillance for things like political dissent, copyright infringement, LGBT imagery, or adult pornography — anything at all beyond irrefutable CSAM — it’ll prove disastrous to Apple’s reputation for privacy protection. <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life\">The EFF seems to see such slipping down the slope as inevitable</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We shall see. The stakes are incredibly high, and Apple knows it. Whatever you think of Apple’s decision to implement these features, they’re not doing so lightly.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2021-08-06\">\n<p><p>Albergotti’s opening, verbatim:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple unveiled a sweeping new set of software tools Thursday that\nwill scan iPhones and other devices for child pornography and text\nmessages with explicit content and report users suspected of\nstoring illegal pictures on their phones to authorities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wrong. The only photos that might be reported to authorities are those being sent to iCloud. “Scanned” is a misleading verb. And the entire “text messages” feature is only for children in shared iCloud family accounts. Albergotti’s alarmist lead makes it sound like all content for all users in Messages will be “scanned”, whereas in fact nothing sent to or from an adult user in Messages will ever be “scanned” — unless an image is saved from Messages to Photos and iCloud Photo Library is enabled.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The aggressive plan to thwart child predators and pedophiles and\nprohibit them from utilizing Apple’s services for illegal activity\npitted the tech giant against civil liberties activists and\nappeared to contradict some of its own long-held assertions about\nprivacy and the way the company interacts with law enforcement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As announced, none of these features contradict any of Apple’s “long-held assertions”.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The move also raises new questions about the nature of smartphones\nand who really owns the computers in their pockets. The new\nsoftware will perform scans on its users’ devices without their\nknowledge or explicit consent, and potentially put innocent users\nin legal jeopardy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>None of this raises any questions about who owns your iPhone. It does assert that Apple owns iCloud’s servers, but no images on an iPhone that isn’t syncing to iCloud Photo Library will ever be fingerprinted. The Messages content warnings for children are explicitly opt in, as is syncing to iCloud Photo Library. Unless Apple’s cryptographic math is catastrophically wrong, it is exceedingly unlikely that innocent users’ photos will ever be flagged, and even if they are flagged for exceeding the threshold for CSAM fingerprint matches, there’s a manual review by Apple before anything is reported to law enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>It’s hard to imagine a three-paragraph lede that is more histrionically misleading than Albergotti’s in this report.</p>&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2021-08-06\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-2021-08-06\">\n<p>The exception is IMAP email, which is encrypted in transit between client and server but is not stored encrypted on the server, because that’s how IMAP was designed. Long story short, email is probably the least secure messaging service you use. If you wouldn’t put it on paper and send via postal mail, don’t send it via email.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr2-2021-08-06\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n\n\n    ",

And so while it’s fair\nto call it Google-designed, it’s also still unclear which\ncomponents are Google-made and which are licensed from others. Two\nthings are definitely coming from Google: a mobile TPU for AI\noperations and a new Titan M2 chip for security. The rest,\nincluding the CPU, GPU, and 5G modem, are all still a mystery.</p>\n\n<p>Less mysterious: the phones themselves. I spent about an hour at\nGoogle’s Mountain View campus last week looking at the phone\nhardware and talking with Google’s hardware chief Rick Osterloh\nabout Tensor. After all that, my main takeaway about the new Pixel\n6 phones is simple.</p>\n\n<p>Google is actually, finally trying to make a competitive\nflagship phone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>“This is the year Google gets serious about Pixel (née Nexus) phones” is right up there with “the next version of Bluetooth is going to be reliable” and “this is the year of desktop Linux” on the list of perennial letdowns. But like Charlie Brown trying to kick Lucy’s football, hope springs eternal, and I’m hopeful Google actually pulls it off this time. The iPhone needs better rivals.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Google Teases Upcoming Pixel 6 and 6 Pro Phones’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/08/03/pixel-6-teaser\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t",

Carroll, chief health officer for Indiana University, in a guest column for The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Many may read the C.D.C.’s continued focus on masking and\ndistancing as an acknowledgment that the vaccines don’t work well\nenough. Leaning heavily on masking and distancing is what we did\nwhen we didn’t have vaccinations. Today, such recommendations are\nless likely to succeed because they are more likely to be followed\nby those already primed to listen — the vaccinated — and to be\nfought and ignored by those who aren’t.</p>\n\n<p>Hospitalizations and deaths are rising in some areas not because\nsomeone didn’t wear a mask at the ballgame. They’re occurring\nbecause too many people are not immunized.</p>\n\n<p>This is why I’ve <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/opinion/covid-vaccine-mandate.html\">advocated</a> vaccine mandates. I don’t understand\nhow we can mandate wearing masks but not getting vaccinations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here’s German Lopez, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2021/7/28/22594637/vaccine-mandates-covid-19-masks-delta-variants\">making the same case at Vox</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A year ago, requiring masks as cases spiked would have been an\nobviously smart decision. Mask mandates <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/21546014/mask-mandates-coronavirus-covid-19\">work</a>, and for most of\n2020, they were among the best methods we had to stop the spread\nof Covid-19. But masks were never meant to be the long-term\nsolution; they were a stopgap until the US and the rest of the\nworld could stamp out epidemics through vaccination.</p>\n\n<p>Now those vaccines are here. And the changed circumstances of\nsummer 2021 call for new approaches. Any entity thinking about a\nmask requirement — from private businesses to local, state, and\nfederal governments — should consider mandating something else\nfirst: vaccination.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Asking the vaccinated to wear masks to protect the voluntarily unvaccinated is not going to work. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/vaccinated-america-breaking-point-anti-vaxxers/619539/\">The backlash is growing</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Mandate Vaccinations, Not Masks’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/29/carroll-mandate-vaccinations\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t",

If you love the new unified design, it’s still there. But my big problem with this tab bar — both on Mac and now iPad — is that it’s very hard to see which tab is the current (selected) tab. The visual indication for “selected” is just a very slightly different background tint — whether you’ve got “Show color in tab bar” enabled or not. You can even scroll the current tab out of view. Why is that possible? I don’t see how this is better than the Safari 14 tab bar in any way, and I see a lot of ways that it’s worse.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘As Promised, Safari for iPadOS 15 Beta 4 Has a Standalone Tab Bar, Like the Mac Version’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/27/safari-15-for-ipados\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t",

Our team has always been inspired by Twitter’s mission to improve public conversation, and we can’t wait to work with the kind, brilliant folks we’ve met there. Together, we’ll do great things. Sadly, this transition also means that our work at Brief is coming to an end. The newsroom will publish our final news bulletins on July 31. […]</p>\n\n<p>We founded this company to foster healthy discourse by rethinking the way we read the news. The only way we can tackle the world’s complex challenges is by doing it together. In this next chapter, we’ll continue our efforts to push the conversation forward, and we hope that everyone who believed in us will do the same.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ugh.</p>\n\n<p>Congrats to Hobbs and Huey (presuming this is a good outcome for them), but man, this is the second iOS app from my <em>first</em> home screen that Twitter has acquired and killed in the last few months. (The other was <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/05/nuzzel\">Nuzzel</a>, which shut down in May, and which I continue to miss every day.)</p>\n\n<p>Brief is an extraordinary app. It cost $5-6/month (it varied over the time I was using it), and you got about 5 major news stories a day. Each story was short — a neat summary with links to sources for more information if you wanted more. That’s it. It was like reading the front page of a good newspaper. Brief didn’t tell you everything — it told you the most important news, and that’s it. No needless notifications, and most importantly, no infinite scroll. Brief wasn’t designed or edited to keep you in Brief for as long as it could. Quite the opposite: Brief was designed and edited to get you in, get you up to date on major national and world news, and get you <em>out</em>. Brief is the only news app I’m aware of that gave you a sense of completeness — the point was to catch up, quickly, and be done. No ads. Just a fair subscription price (that I would have happily paid much more for.) For god’s sake Brief defaulted to <em>not</em> sending you any notifications at all. No notifications. They just assumed you’d open Brief when you wanted to see if there was fresh news. When’s the last time you saw a news app that defaulted to not trying to send you notifications, let alone not bombarding you with them?</p>\n\n<p>Even the company’s name — Broadsheet — harkened back to the days of print newspapers and their <em>finiteness</em>. When you finish reading Section A of The New York Times, you’re done. You can stop, without worrying that you’re missing anything. Brief is like that, except just 5 or so stories per day.</p>\n\n<p>Also, Brief is a beautiful app, designed specifically for iOS. It has a better and more iOS-like design and interaction model than Apple’s own News app. I don’t say this lightly, but its design was nearly perfect. I don’t know what Twitter plans to do with it, but given that Brief was pretty much the opposite of Twitter, experience-wise, I’m deeply pessimistic. Twitter’s apps have non-native designs and all try to keep you “engaged” for as long as possible.</p>\n\n<p>I want more apps with a <em>finite</em> scroll, which respect, rather than seek to consume, my time and attention.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Brief Grief’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/27/twitter-acquires-brief\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t",

Finally decided to tell a bit of that story here.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://read.cv/cleer/1R6eDCnOEDMDlRjMDbq8\">His story</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I created the original concept and pitch for Chrome Home in 2016. It was based off two insights:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Phones were growing in size, and we had opportunity to innovate in creating a gestural, spatial interface that would still be usable with one hand.</p></li>\n<li><p>Mobile Chrome was also growing in features — but because its minimalist interface kept everything behind a “three dot” menu, these features were underutilized and hard to access.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The idea caught traction internally, eventually becoming a Chrome org priority. […]</p>\n\n<p>We heard a mixture of reactions. The feature gained a cult following among the tech community, but for many mainstream users, the change felt disorienting. Chrome serves billions of users around the globe with varying tech literacy. Over the course of many iterations, I became increasingly convinced that launching Chrome Home would not serve all our users well.</p>\n\n<p>So just as I strongly as I had pitched the original concept, I advocated for us to stop the launch — which took not a small amount of debate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Really curious to see what the next betas of Safari look like on iOS and iPadOS. I spent all weekend with my spare phone running iOS 15 b3 and the new Safari design is not growing on me, at all.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Chrome Home — Abandoned Redesign of Mobile Chrome Circa 2016, With Goals Similar to Those of Mobile Safari 15’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/26/chrome-home\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t",

He argued that gas-electric hybrids like the Prius and hydrogen-powered cars should play a bigger role, according to four people familiar with the talks.</p>\n\n<p>Behind that position is a business quandary: Even as other automakers have embraced electric cars, Toyota bet its future on the development of hydrogen fuel cells — a costlier technology that has fallen far behind electric batteries — with greater use of hybrids in the near term. That means a rapid shift from gasoline to electric on the roads could be devastating for the company’s market share and bottom line.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This sounds like a once-great company that has lost its way.

[…]</p>\n\n<p>“We’ve come to the same conclusion as others: web apps are the only option for streaming cloud games on iOS at the moment,” Facebook’s vice president of gaming, Vivek Sharma, told The Verge in a statement. “As many have pointed out, Apple’s policy to ‘allow’ cloud games on the App Store doesn’t allow for much at all. Apple’s requirement for each cloud game to have its own page, go through review, and appear in search listings defeats the purpose of cloud gaming. These roadblocks mean players are prevented from discovering new games, playing cross-device, and accessing high-quality games instantly in native iOS apps — even for those who aren’t using the latest and most expensive devices.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There’s a lot to roll your eyes at in this brief statement, but the big one is the last clause, implying that Apple’s stance on cloud gaming has anything at all to do with pushing people to buy the “latest and most expensive devices”. Say what you want about Apple’s App Store policies, they go to great lengths to keep older devices relevant for as long as possible — including with their own library of Apple Arcade games.</p>\n\n<p>Will be interesting to see if these web app games are actually good, and if so, actually become popular.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Facebook Brings Cloud Games to iOS via Web App’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/24/facebook-web-app-games\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t",

      "content": "\n<p>“<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/19/kirvin-safari-15-defense\">You should only see a button when you need it</a>” seems to explain many of Apple’s recent UI directions. File proxy icons in MacOS document windows, for example, disappeared last year in MacOS 11 Big Sur — or rather, were hidden until you moused over them. <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2020/10/05/big-surs-hidden-document-proxy-icon/\">This post from Michael Tsai</a> has documented reactions and tips regarding this change over the last year — including the fact that in the MacOS 12 Monterey betas, proxy icons can be turned back on using an Accessibility setting in System Preferences. (If you think Accessibility is just for people with vision or motor skill problems, you’ve been missing out on some great system-wide settings for tweaking both MacOS and iOS.)</p>\n\n<p>Does removing proxy icons from document window title bars reduce “clutter”? I can only assume that’s what Apple’s HI team was thinking. But I’d argue strenuously that proxy icons aren’t needless clutter — they’re <a href=\"http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=2010031117415674\">useful</a>, and showing them by default made them discoverable. Keeping them visible reminds you that they’re there. There’s a one-to-one relationship between a document icon in the Finder and the open application window for that document; showing the document icon in the window title bar reinforced that concept. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chucker/status/1395843084383043584\">This hidden Finder preference for MacOS 11 Big Sur</a> delights me, because in addition to showing proxy icons, it also restores grabbable title bars in MacOS 11.</p>\n\n<p>In a sense, no personal computer interface can out-minimalize an old terminal command line — just a blinking cursor on a black screen, awaiting your commands. The Mac’s breakthrough was establishing an interface where you could see — and thus discover through visual exploration — not just what you <em>had</em> done, but what you <em>could</em> do. Proxy icons in title bars weren’t added to classic Mac OS until version 8.5 in 1998, but they exemplified that philosophy. They said: <em>Even though this document is open in an editing window, you can still do things with the file — here it is.</em></p>\n\n<p>It’s devilishly hard work deciding what to expose at the top level of a user interface. Microsoft went overboard <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/uxguide/cmd-ribbons\">for decades of versions of Windows</a> with <a href=\"http://www.newdesignfile.com/post_microsoft-office-toolbar-icons_80811/\">way too many</a> inscrutable <a href=\"http://drops.caseyliss.com/VC9qbu\">tiny toolbar icons</a>. But like almost every design challenge, it’s a Goldilocks problem — you can go too far in the other direction, and there is no “just right” that will please everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n    ",

      "content": "\n<p>A good mid-summer silly story from earlier today. Chaim Gartenberg, writing at The Verge, “<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/7/13/22575368/apple-ios-14-weather-app-69-rounding-error-15\">Apple’s Weather App Won’t Say It’s 69 Degrees</a>”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you’re an iPhone user, the weather is always a particularly\nnice 70 degrees. Or 68 degrees. Any temperature but 69 degrees,\nactually, because it turns out that the built-in weather app on\nsome versions of iOS — including the current version, iOS 14.6 — will refuse to display <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/06/why-69-is-the-internets-coolest-number-sex.html\">the internet’s favorite number</a>, even\nif the actual temperature in a given location is, in fact, 69\ndegrees, along with several other (less meme-able) numerals like\n65 and 71 degrees.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not clear if this is a bug or an intentional attempt from\nApple to cut down on 69-related humor. The rounding is only\nvisible in the weather app itself: clicking through to Apple’s\nsource data from Weather.com will show the proper temperature, as\ndo Apple’s home screen widgets. But the iOS weather app will\nrefuse to show 69 degrees anywhere in the forecast, whether it’s\nfor the current temperature, the hourly forecast for the day, or\nthe extended forecast.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Marques Brownlee followed with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1414974137332867072\">a quick side-by-side demo</a> with an Android phone. But it was soon pointed out by commenters on Twitter that while true for the Weather app in iOS 14.6, it’s not the case in the current betas for iOS 15. (It’s also not the case for iOS 13, which I still have running on a spare phone.) Gartenberg soon updated his story at The Verge with the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A possible explanation for the issue (as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theMarcDufresne/status/1414981789052030987\">pointed out by\nseveral</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nannerb/status/1414981582318878722\">people on Twitter</a>) is that Apple may be\nsourcing data for its iOS Weather app in Celsius and then\nconverting it to Fahrenheit. For example, 20 degrees Celsius\nconverts to 68 degrees Fahrenheit, while 21 degrees Celsius\nconverts to 69.8 degrees Fahrenheit — which rounds up to 70\ndegrees Fahrenheit. The app appears to have similar issues with\ntemperatures like 65 degrees (where 18 degrees Celsius converts to\n64.4 degrees Fahrenheit, while 19 degrees Celsius is 66.2 degrees\nFahrenheit).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This theory that it’s a side effect of converting Celsius integer values to Fahrenheit integer values strikes me as almost certainly correct — especially considering that it affects un-notable values like “65”. Or that even in iOS 14.6, <em>negative</em> 69°F <a href=\"https://twitter.com/largent_connor/status/1414976667219542016\">displays just fine</a>. But it’s amusing to me that so many people bought into the possibility that someone at Apple thought it was a good idea to avoid showing 69° as a temperature.</p>\n\n<p>Apple’s Compass app will show you 69°. The Finder will tell you if you have 69 files in a folder. Once you start down this path it’s hard to find an app from Apple that <em>won’t</em> display “69” some how, some way, if that’s the value that ought to be displayed. Apple even has <a href=\"https://www.techspot.com/news/67429-apple-replace-single-lost-or-broken-airpod-69.html\">products that cost $69</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But Apple’s reputation for prudishness precedes it.</p>\n\n<p>What didn’t pass the sniff test for me with this “won’t show 69°F” idea is that it would cross the line into losing integrity, or at least losing <em>accuracy</em>. Can I imagine a third-party weather app being rejected from the App Store because its screenshots show a big “69°F” current temperature? Yes. But to program the iPhone Weather app to avoid displaying 69°F when it really is 69°F? (Or to demand a third-party weather app not show “69°F” in the app?) No.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes a cigar is just an integer math conversion glitch.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>I’m reminded of the spate of articles a few years ago, when Apple’s original TV+ titles were ramping up production, that Apple executives were squeamish about R-rated content. E.g. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-sex-please-were-apple-iphone-giant-seeks-tv-success-on-its-own-terms-1537588880\">this widely-cited report</a> by Tripp Mickle and Joe Flint for The Wall Street Journal in September 2018, which claimed, “The tech giant wants to make scripted shows for streaming, only without violence, politics and risqué story lines.” It didn’t seem preposterous in the least that Apple might have been looking for a Disney-esque “family-friendly only” image for its original content.</p>\n\n<p>Problem is: <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/02/04/cue-ny-post\">it wasn’t true</a>. <em>Ted Lasso</em> sure is a feel-good show, but Apple’s acclaimed <em>The Morning Show</em> is just as surely not. <em>Servant</em> is R-rated horror (or pretty close to R-rated). <em>See</em> was a show about a future world <a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a29637626/see-apple-tv-masturbation-scene-queen-kane/\">where everyone is blind and they pray to their god by masturbating</a>. Disney+ probably wasn’t bidding on that.</p>\n\n\n\n    ",

      "content": "\n<p><a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/06/17/safari-15/\">Michael Tsai</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I think I like the changes for iPhone. The controls are easier to\nreach at the bottom of the screen, and it’s quicker to switch\nbetween tabs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I get the move to the bottom, in theory — clearly this is about reachability. But I use Safari on my iPhone <em>a lot</em> and I have never minded using a second hand to get to the controls that, heretofore, were at the top: the “ᴀA” menu, the location field, and the reload/stop button. </p>\n\n<p>Here are screenshots from Safari on iOS 14.6:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/misc/2021/06/ios-safari-14-6.png\" class=\"noborder\">\n  <img\n    src = \"/misc/2021/06/ios-safari-14-6.png\"\n    alt = \"Screenshot of mjtsai.com in Safari on iOS 14.6.\"\n    width = 450\n  /></a></p>\n\n<p>and iOS 15 beta 2:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/misc/2021/06/ios-safari-15b2.png\" class=\"noborder\">\n  <img\n    src = \"/misc/2021/06/ios-safari-15b2.png\"\n    alt = \"Screenshot of mjtsai.com in Safari on iOS 14.6.\"\n    width = 450\n  /></a></p>\n\n<p>Both the old and new designs put these controls one tap away: back/forward, location field, and the tabs button.</p>\n\n<p>The only other one-tap control in the new design is the “···” <s>junk drawer</s> menu button, which can be long-pressed to toggle Reader Mode. All the other controls are inside the “···” popover menu.</p>\n\n<p>The old design has no “···” menu because it doesn’t need one. It has an “ᴀA” button at the top which can be long-pressed to toggle Reader Mode and when tapped shows a popover menu of site-specific viewing options. At the bottom it has one-tap buttons for Share and Bookmarks. I use the Share and Bookmarks buttons <em>all the time</em> on my iPhone.</p>\n\n<p>The system-wide standard iOS/iPadOS Share popover menu is one of the best UIs Apple has come up with in the last decade. It is extremely useful, very well supported by both first- and third-party apps, and extraordinarily <em>consistent</em> across the entire system. Because it is widely supported and very consistent, it is well understood by users. I realize that the nature of my work is such that I deal with URLs more frequently than most people, but sharing URLs is really common.</p>\n\n<p>I also think the “ᴀA” button is a much better idea than putting all the options previously contained therein in the catch-all “···” menu. Long-pressing “ᴀA” to toggle Reader Mode feels intuitive; long-pressing “···” to toggle Reader Mode feels like they <a href=\"https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1402746553060806659\">just didn’t know where else to put it</a>. The new iOS Safari “···” menu <a href=\"https://pxlnv.com/linklog/wwdc-discoverable-design/\">could have been a “here’s what <em>not</em> to do” example</a> from Apple’s own <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10126/?time=287\">WWDC session this year on “Discoverable Design</a>”.</p>\n\n<p>Bookmarks are almost completely lost in the new design, and unless I’m missing something, there’s no longer any way to run bookmarklets. I know bookmarklets are an old-school web nerd thing, but I have a few I use frequently, which, if Apple sticks with this design for the next year, I guess I’ll have to rewrite as Shortcuts shortcuts or something.<sup id=\"fnr1-2021-07-02\"><a href=\"#fn1-2021-07-02\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The only new thing the new iOS Safari design has going for it is that you can swipe side-to-side on the floating browser chrome at the bottom to switch between tabs. I don’t think that is significantly more convenient than tapping the Tabs buttons to switch tabs. How often you want to swipe through tabs one at a time rather than <em>see</em> your tabs and select one in particular? And if you swipe just a little bit too low, you wind up switching between <em>apps</em>, not tabs.</p>\n\n<p>All that said, I agree with Tsai that the new Safari for Mac is even worse:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For Mac, the new design makes no sense to me, and I’ll likely\nswitch to Chrome if it can’t be disabled:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Not only does the location bar <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattbirchler/status/1405348487546429448\">move</a> when you change tabs,\nbut, because it changes width, all the other tabs move, too. It\nfeels disorienting.</li>\n<li>With everything on one line, there’s less space for tab text\nthan before.</li>\n<li>It’s harder to get at buttons and extensions <a href=\"https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1402743028536819718\">hidden</a> under\nthe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/siracusa/status/1402715575449686016\">… menu</a>.</li>\n<li>There’s less empty space where it’s safe for me to click in\norder to drag the window.</li>\n<li>Having the page background color bleed into the tab area makes\nit harder to read, and it feels weird for the current page’s\ncolor to affect the way <em>other</em> tabs look. It also works\ninconsistently, even on the same pages on Apple’s site. At least\nthere’s a preference to turn it off.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You don’t have to install MacOS 12 Monterey to use the new Safari design; the latest versions of <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/\">Safari Technology Preview</a> have it too, and Safari Technology Preview is installed as a separate app, not a replacement for the current version of Safari.</p>\n\n<p>Tabs in Safari on Mac (and, in my opinion, iPad) were a solved problem. The new Safari tab UI strikes me as being different for the sake of being different, not different for the sake of being better. The new design certainly makes Safari look distinctive. But is it more usable or discoverable in <em>any</em> way? I honestly can’t think of a single problem the new design solves other than saving about 30 points (60 @2× pixels) of vertical screen space by omitting a dedicated tab bar. But I think the tab bar was space put to good, obvious use with traditional tabs.\n<a href=\"https://birchtree.me/blog/safari-15-what-you-gain-and-at-what-cost/\">Matt Birchler points out</a> that horizontally, the new tab design uses space <em>less</em> efficiently. Good luck convincing Chrome users to switch to Safari with this design. Not to mention that every other tabbed app in MacOS 12 still uses a traditional tab bar. It’s consistent neither with other popular web browsers nor with the rest of MacOS 12.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pxlnv.com/blog/safari-15-chickenshit-minimalism/\">Nick Heer, writing at Pixel Envy</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Over the past several releases of MacOS and iOS, Apple has\nexperimented with hiding controls until users hover their cursor\novertop, click, tap, or swipe. I see it as an extension of what\n<a href=\"https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm#minimalism\">Maciej Cegłowski memorably called</a> “chickenshit minimalism”.\nHe defined it as “the illusion of simplicity backed by megabytes\nof cruft”; I see parallels in a “junk drawer” approach that\nprioritizes the appearance of simplicity over functional clarity.\nIt adds complexity because it reduces clutter, and it allows UI\ndesigners to avoid making choices about interface hierarchy by\nburying everything but the most critical elements behind vague\ncontrols.</p>\n\n<p>If UI density is a continuum, the other side of chickenshit\nminimalism might be something like Microsoft’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribbon_(computing)#Microsoft_software\">“ribbon”\ntoolbar</a>. Dozens of controls of various sizes and types,\nloosely grouped by function, and separated by a tabbed UI\ncreates a confusing mess. But being unnecessarily reductionist\nwith onscreen controls also creates confusion. I do not want\nevery web browser control available at all times, but I cannot\nsee what users gain by making it harder to find the reload\nbutton in Safari.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>There’s an axiom widely (but alas, probably <a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/\">spuriously</a>) attributed to Albert Einstein: “Everything should be as simple as possible, but not simpler.” But I don’t even think that applies to this new Safari design. It’s worse. It just <em>looks</em> simpler. All the old functionality remains — it’s just harder to access, harder to discover intuitively, and more distracting. One can only presume that Apple’s HI team thinks they’re reducing needless “clutter”, but what they’re doing is systematically removing the coherence between what apps look like and the functionality they offer.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s another axiom, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/01/23/how-it-works\">whose attribution is certain</a>: “Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think it’s this veneer — that the designers are handed this box and told, ‘Make it look good!’ That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-2021-07-02\">\n<p>“AppleScript scripts” has always felt a little repetitively awkward, but talking about shortcuts in Shortcuts is worse.

      "content": "\n<p>Apple today released a white paper arguing against proposed legislation that would mandate the ability to sideload apps (and thereby alternative app stores) on iOS/iPadOS:<sup id=\"fnr1-2021-06-23\"><a href=\"#fn1-2021-06-23\">1</a></sup> “<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Building_a_Trusted_Ecosystem_for_Millions_of_Apps.pdf\">Building a Trusted Ecosystem for Millions of Apps</a>”.<sup id=\"fnr2-2021-06-23\"><a href=\"#fn2-2021-06-23\">2</a></sup> I think it’s good, fair, and cogent. I highly encourage you to read it — it’s not long — then come back for my annotations below.</p>\n\n<p>The paper opens with this quote from Steve Jobs, <a href=\"https://tidbits.com/2007/10/17/steve-jobss-iphone-sdk-letter/\">announcing the iPhone SDK</a>:<sup id=\"fnr3-2021-06-23\"><a href=\"#fn3-2021-06-23\">3</a></sup></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“We’re trying to do two diametrically opposed things at once:\nprovide an advanced and open platform to developers while at the\nsame time protect iPhone users from viruses, malware, privacy\nattacks, etc. This is no easy task.” — Steve Jobs, 2007</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As ever, Steve Jobs was a succinct and forceful communicator. That “diametrically opposed” tension he described at the outset, 14 years ago, remains exactly the core of Apple’s argument in this paper today.</p>\n\n<p>Page 4, under a section subtitled “This approach to security and privacy has been highly effective”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Additionally, even users who prefer to only download apps from the\nApp Store could be forced to download an app they need for work or\nfor school from third-party stores if it is not made available on\nthe App Store. Or they could be tricked into downloading apps from\nthird-party app stores masquerading as the App Store.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This, to me, is perhaps <em>the</em> key point that sideloading proponents ignore. Arguments in favor of allowing sideloading on iOS, from users, tend to boil down to “<em>It’s my device, I should be allowed to install whatever I want. If most users want to stick with the App Store, that’s fine for them and they’ll keep all the benefits as they currently stand, while I and others will have the freedom to install whatever we want.</em>” That argument is not wrong! There <em>would</em> be benefits to allowing sideloading, exactly along the lines of how there are benefits to being able to install apps outside the App Store via TestFlight, enterprise distribution, and compiling apps from source code with Xcode.</p>\n\n<p>Sideloading would take things to a new level though. TestFlight still requires some approval from Apple, and TestFlight distribution is limited to 10,000 users. Enterprise distribution requires an enterprise certificate from Apple. And compiling from source code requires a developer account, significant technical expertise, and, well, the source code to the app.</p>\n\n<p>What the sideloading arguments ignore are the enormous tradeoffs involved. Yes, there would be benefits — a lot of cool apps that aren’t permitted in the App Store would be installable by as many iOS users as want to install them. But many non-technical users would inevitably wind up installing undesirable apps via work/school requirements or trickery that they could not be required or tricked into installing today. Consider just the example of “proctoring apps” that students are required to install for remote test taking. They’re a surveillance menace, <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/08/proctoring-apps-subject-students-unnecessary-surveillance\">as the EFF reported in August</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Technically, yes, on platforms that allow it, sideloading is the user’s choice. But socially and psychologically, it often isn’t.<sup id=\"fnr4-2021-06-23\"><a href=\"#fn4-2021-06-23\">4</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Page 4:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the end, users would have to constantly be on the lookout for\nscams, never knowing who or what to trust, and as a result many\nusers would download fewer apps from fewer developers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is another key point that cannot be overstated. As things stand today, you cannot “mess up” your iOS device by installing the wrong software. You can easily uninstall all traces of any app you do install with a tap-and-hold on the app’s icon. No app you install can <a href=\"https://chromeisbad.com/\">entrench invisible background agents that act like system software</a>. And because of this, hundreds of millions of non-technical iOS users install far more software on their iOS devices than they do or did on their PCs — <em>including Macs</em>. This, despite the fact that PCs are far more powerful devices. Typical users install more apps on their less capable phones than they do on their far more capable PCs. This is as close as we can get to proof that Apple’s App Store model on iOS hasn’t just worked, but has proven to be wildly successful <em>and popular with users</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Related point: An app’s ability to even <em>request</em> access to health data, or contacts, or to create a VPN, rests on App Store review. If an app says it’s a game but requests the entitlement to prompt the user for access to health data, Apple’s App Store review will reject it. An Epic-run App Store would be making parallel and different decisions about which entitlements to grant to which apps. A sideloaded app would make those decisions for itself. Surveillance tracking would go back to “whatever the app wants to do”.</p>\n\n<p>Page 9:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>iPhone is used every day by over a billion people — for banking,\nto manage health data, and to take pictures of their families.\nThis large user base would make an appealing and lucrative target\nfor cybercriminals and scammers, and allowing sideloading would\nspur a flood of new investment into attacks on iPhone, well beyond\nthe scale of attacks on other platforms like Mac.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here Apple dances around the elephant in the room — the question of why iOS shouldn’t just work like the Mac with regard to non-App Store software. Apple’s deft argument is that there are far fewer Macs than iOS devices, making the Mac a less enticing target for scammers and crooks (including privacy crooks). That’s more or less the argument Windows proponents used to explain the profound prevalence of malware on Windows compared to the Mac back in the day, whilst Apple (and Mac proponents) argued otherwise, that the Mac actually was far more secure at a technical level.</p>\n\n<p>But the truth Apple won’t come out and say is that it’s <em>both</em>. The Mac <em>was</em> more secure by design, but <em>also</em> a far less enticing target because of how many more users were (and still are) on Windows. And, today, iOS <em>is</em> more secure and private than the Mac. That’s the nature of the Mac as a full PC platform.</p>\n\n<p>I’ll admit it: if Mac-style sideloading were added to iOS, I’d enable it, for the same reason I enable installing apps from outside the App Store on my Mac: I trust myself to only install trustworthy software. But it doesn’t make me a hypocrite to say that I think it would be worse for the platform as a whole.<sup id=\"fnr5-2021-06-23\"><a href=\"#fn5-2021-06-23\">5</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The Mac is fundamentally designed for users who are at least <em>somewhat</em> technically savvy, but tries its best to keep non-savvy users from doing things they shouldn’t. But you can always hurt yourself, sometimes badly, with any true power tool. The iPhone is the converse: designed first and foremost for the non-savvy user, and tries to accommodate power users as best it can within the limits of that primary directive.</p>\n\n<p>Page 11:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>The goal of App Review is to ensure that apps on the App Store\nare trustworthy</em> and that the information provided on an app’s App\nStore page accurately represents how the app works and what data\nit will access. We are constantly improving this process: we\nupdate and refine our tools and our methodology continuously.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The problem Apple is facing today is that it’s clear that one word in the above is inaccurate: the opening “the”. The above is <em>a</em> goal of the App Store — and I would argue that it remains the <em>primary</em> goal. But clearly the App Store serves another goal for Apple: making the company money. Exhibit A: <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2020/06/hey_app_store_rejection_flimsiness\">last year’s Hey fiasco</a>. Nothing about Apple’s rejection of Hey (or, I’d wager, some number of <em>thousands</em> of other apps flagged by App Store review for similar reasons) was about trustworthiness. It was about money.</p>\n\n<p>That’s a conflict of interest, and it detracts significantly from Apple’s entirely legitimate trustworthiness argument defending the App Store model for distribution. I remain convinced Apple wouldn’t be facing these regulatory pressures today <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/app_store_the_schiller_cut\">if they’d walked away from a strategy of maximizing App Store profits years ago</a>, and I also think they could largely dissipate these pressures today by doing it now — better late than never.</p>\n\n<p>Also on page 11:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Once users download an app through the App Store, they are able to\ncontrol how that app functions and what data it is able to access</em>,\nusing features such as App Tracking Transparency and permissions.\nParents can further control what their kids buy with the Ask to\nBuy feature, how much time they spend on certain categories of\napps with Screen Time features, and what data they share. Users\nare also able to centrally manage all app-related payments, and\nare able to easily view and cancel subscriptions that are paid for\nvia In-App Payments. These controls could not be fully enforced on\nsideloaded apps.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All of this is true. But that last point, that <em>all</em> in-app subscriptions are listed in an obvious location, where it’s easy to unsubscribe, and you get email notifications before every renewal, is the singular reason why I think Apple should not — and should not be forced to — allow in-app purchases and especially subscriptions via developers’ own payment systems. What I endorse is allowing apps to direct users to the web to make purchases and subscriptions. In-app purchases vs. out-app purchases. Let Apple earn its cut by showing that in-app purchases have higher conversions.</p>\n\n<p>My favorite example is The New York Times — by all accounts a reputable and trustworthy company. Subscribe to the Times in-app, where Apple gets a cut, and you can easily unsubscribe at any time with two taps in the Settings apps. Subscribe to the Times on their website, and you literally have to <a href=\"https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003499613-Cancel-your-subscription\">call them on the telephone and argue with a Times rep</a> whose job is to talk you out of unsubscribing.</p>\n\n<p>The current in-app purchase requirements are incredibly reassuring to me, as a user. I subscribe to many publications and services through in-app purchase that I would not subscribe to otherwise. Let apps <em>offer</em> the ability to use their own purchasing systems, but make it clear they’re doing so on the web, not in-app. (That’s what Hey does — and people trust Hey because they trust the company behind it.)</p>\n\n<p>Page 12, in a list of statistics of App Store “protections in action in 2020”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Apple deactivated 244 million customer accounts due to fraudulent\nand abusive activity, including fake reviews</em>. It also rejected\n424 million attempted account creations due to fraudulent and\nabusive patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My reaction to these numbers: <em>Jiminy!</em></p>\n\n<p>Assuming these number are accurate, they explain Apple’s seeming nonchalance to the continuing existence of scam apps that do get into the App Store, and the pervasiveness of fraudulent reviews. They’re catching the overwhelming majority of them.</p>\n\n<p>I still say: <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/search/bunco+squad\">not good enough</a>, especially on the task of identifying and eliminating <em>successful</em> scams. But, still, wow, those are big numbers.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-2021-06-23\">\n<p>Apple actually only talks about the iPhone in the white paper — the word “iPad” doesn’t appear once. But iPadOS and iOS are exactly the same in every regard discussed in the paper. I think Apple wisely focused on iPhone to keep it simple. I’ll do the same, and write only “iOS” as shorthand for “iOS and iPadOS” (and WatchOS and tvOS, for that matter).&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2021-06-23\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-2021-06-23\">\n<p>It’s a PDF, not a web page, which is typical for “white paper” type things. But the biggest downside to publishing it as a PDF is that it’s hard to read on a phone, which feels at least slightly ironic. (Kudos to Apple though for the PDF’s svelte 295 KB file size, despite being illustrated throughout.)&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr2-2021-06-23\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn3-2021-06-23\">\n<p>Amusingly, Apple had to source Jobs’s quote to <a href=\"https://tidbits.com/2007/10/17/steve-jobss-iphone-sdk-letter/\">TidBITS’s archived copy</a> of Jobs’s open letter announcing the SDK, because Apple never gave it a permalink at apple.com. In his preface to TidBITS’s hosted copy of the letter, Adam Engst wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some things need to be in the permanent record, and since Apple\ndidn’t see fit to give a permanent URL to Steve Jobs’s letter\nannouncing that Apple would be creating an SDK for third party\niPhone native applications, I’m reproducing it below for future\nreference.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even Apple apparently now agrees the letter belongs in the permanent record.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr3-2021-06-23\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn4-2021-06-23\">\n<p>As an aside, this is why it would be a terrible idea to enrich WebKit into a full technical peer to native apps, or allow alternative web rendering engines empowered with such features, <a href=\"https://infrequently.org/2021/04/progress-delayed/\">as many web developers shortsightedly, and recklessly (and perhaps selfishly) desire</a>. As things stand, WebKit allows users to go anywhere they want on the web, and install any web apps they want as apps on their iOS home screens — but WebKit’s limits are such that they can do so <em>without concern or any degree of technical savviness</em> because WebKit only offers functionality that is safe, secure, and private. Not to mention the fact that a world where any mobile app could be written as a pure web app would inevitably quickly devolve into a world where most apps are identical on iOS and Android, which is neither good for Apple <em>nor</em> for iOS users who prefer truly native iOS apps that fit in with Apple’s system-wide design idioms and integrate with iOS’s unique features.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr4-2021-06-23\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 4 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn5-2021-06-23\">\n<p>My spitball idea for sideloading would be for Apple to create a “developer mode” on iOS devices that allows for Mac-style sideloading of apps. Something that requires a <em>paid</em> Apple developer account. No one is going to get tricked or bamboozled into signing up for a $100/year ADC account. And when (not if) some users who enable it wind up installing foolish software, “developer mode” is a pretty good way of saying “you should know better”. And disabling “developer mode” would, if possible, render inert any software on the device installed via this means. Just my spitball.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr5-2021-06-23\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 5 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n\n\n    ",

      "content": "\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/21/technology/sundar-pichai-google.html\">Daisuke Wakabayashi, reporting for The New York Times</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is hard to argue that things aren’t going great for Google.\nRevenue and profits are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/technology/alphabet-google-earnings.html\">charting new highs</a> every three\nmonths. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is worth $1.6 trillion.\nGoogle has rooted itself deeper and deeper into the lives of\neveryday Americans.</p>\n\n<p>But a restive class of Google executives worry that the company is\nshowing cracks. They say Google’s work force is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/technology/google-sexual-harassment-walkout.html\">increasingly\noutspoken</a>. Personnel problems are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/technology/google-researcher-timnit-gebru.html\">spilling into the\npublic</a>. Decisive leadership and big ideas have given way to\nrisk aversion and incrementalism. And some of those executives are\nleaving and letting everyone know exactly why.</p>\n\n<p>Fifteen current and former Google executives, speaking on the\ncondition of anonymity for fear of angering Google and Mr. Pichai,\ntold The New York Times that Google was suffering from many of the\npitfalls of a large, maturing company — a paralyzing bureaucracy,\na bias toward inaction and a fixation on public perception.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think there’s something interesting going on here, but Wakabayashi’s lede is far juicier than the meat of the article warrants. I’d argue that it boils down to the fact that Pichai has transformed Google into a more focused, and perhaps more boring, company, and that his internal critics preferred the old Google culture — one that did things just because they seemed clever or cool, not because they were necessarily strategically useful to the company. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2013/12/thoughts_on_google_glass\">Google Glass</a>, for example.</p>\n\n<p>A comparison to Apple (shocking, coming from me, I know) is apt. Apple has  touted that when it comes to product ideas, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAEPqUtra6E\">they have “a thousand no’s for every yes”</a>. Coincidentally, that WWDC-opening video is from 2013, the same year Google Glass became available. In 2013, Steve Jobs’s death was still a fresh emotional wound. But that “thousand no’s for every yes” mantra wasn’t defining a new Apple, it was clarifying that post-Jobs Apple would remain the same Apple. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8eP99neOVs\">Here’s Jobs at that extraordinary open-question session at WWDC 1997</a>, at the very start of the Apple-NeXT reunification that marks the beginning of modern Apple, explaining that “Focusing is about saying no.”</p>\n\n<p>It seems undeniable that under Pichai, Google is more focused: more no’s, fewer yes’s. The sources in Wakabayashi’s report clearly want more yes’s. Maybe they’re right! Google is quite obviously a different company with a very different culture than Apple. But the results under Pichai, so far, <a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=GOOG+market+cap+24+October+2015+to+21+June+2021\">are pretty good</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s one of the examples cited by Wakabayashi:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A common critique among current and former executives is that Mr.\nPichai’s slow deliberations often feel like a way to play it safe\nand arrive at a “no.”</p>\n\n<p>Google executives proposed the idea of acquiring Shopify as a way\nto challenge Amazon in online commerce a few years ago. Mr. Pichai\nrejected the idea because he thought Shopify was too expensive,\ntwo people familiar with the discussions said.</p>\n\n<p>But those people said that they had never thought Mr. Pichai had\nthe stomach for a deal and that the price was a convenient and\nultimately misguided justification. Shopify’s share price has\nincreased almost tenfold in the last few years. Jason Post, a\nGoogle spokesman, said, “There was never a serious discussion of\nthis acquisition.”</p>\n\n<p>One former executive said the company’s risk aversion was embodied\nby a state of perpetual research and development known internally\nas “pantry mode.” Teams will stash away products in case a rival\ncreates something new and Google needs to respond quickly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One person’s overcaution is another’s focus.</p>\n\n\n\n    ",
